Exercise: Solve the Puzzle
You are required to create a python program to solve a math puzzle. Follow these steps to write your solution:
Start with Two Numbers: 	(2 marks)
Think of two numbers, 
the first number should represent the base of a calculation (e.g., 8), 
the second number should represent how many times this base should be multiplied by itself (exponential).
Store these numbers in variables with meaningful names.
Calculate the Power:		(1 mark)	
Multiply the first number by itself, based on the second number, and store the result in another variable.
Work with Another Number:`(2 marks)
Choose a third number that is larger than your first number (e.g., 50).
Divide this large number by the first number and save both the quotient (ignoring the remainder) and the exact division result (including decimals) in two separate variables.
Find the Final Value:		(1 mark)
Add all your results together (the power result, the quotient, and the exact division result).
Store this final value in a variable.
Display the Results:		(2 marks)
Print the final value.
Print the type of the final value to check what kind of data it is.

Hints:
Think carefully about the operations you need to use for repeated multiplication, whole-number division, and exact division.
Choose clear and meaningful names for your variables so it's easy to understand your code.


Follow-Up Task: Submit Your Solution via GitHub	(2 marks)
Once you’ve completed the coding assignment, follow these steps to submit your work:
Clone the Repository:
Clone the repository to your local computer so you can work on the files. https://github.com/eria-developer/lesson-examples
Create a New Branch:
Inside the repository, create a new branch for your work.
Name the branch clearly, such as one that includes your name 
Add Your Solution:
Add your Python file with the solution to the repository. Use a meaningful file name.
Save your changes and prepare them for submission.
Commit Your Changes:
Write a clear message explaining what changes you made.
Make sure your message is professional and describes the work you’ve done.
Push Your Branch to GitHub:
Push the branch you created, along with your changes, to the repository on GitHub.
Create a Pull Request:
Go to the repository on GitHub.
Create a pull request for your branch.
Write a clear and descriptive title and add a short explanation of what your code does.
Submit the Pull Request:
Once the pull request is ready, submit it for review.
Upload a document:
Go back to your portal, submit a document having your full name and the name of the branch you created
